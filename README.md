# Tableau Dashboards Customizing - Lab

## Introduction
We have taken a look at the tools available for building a _Dashboard_ in the previous lesson. In this lab, we will put those tools to use. We will start with a data set, and create a few visualizations to help highlight some important information for the stakeholder, and finally we will combine that work into a useful _Dashboard_ that can be shared.

## Objectives
You will be able to: 
* Create a Dashboard with 3 informative vizzes
* Add and customize a title and header ti the Dashboard
* Add an interactive element to the vizzes

## Import the Data
For this lab, you will continue to use the Superstore data set you have been using and you will use the visualizations you have already created. You should have saved the workbook you used in the __Useful Visualizations Lab__ so we will use those worksheets and assemble them into a _Dashboard_ that and we will add some interactivity to it as well.

## Create a Dashboard
Using one of the two methods described in the previous lesson, create a new blank _Dashboard_.  Once the _Dashboard is open, you should see all of your worksheets you have created on the left side of the screen
