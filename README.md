# Tableau Dashboards Customizing - Lab

## Introduction
We have taken a look at the tools available for building a _Dashboard_ in the previous lesson. In this lab, we will put those tools to use. We will start with a data set, and create a few visualizations to help highlight some important information for the stakeholder, and finally we will combine that work into a useful _Dashboard_ that can be shared.

## Objectives
You will be able to: 
* Create a Dashboard with 3 informative vizzes
* Add and customize a title and header ti the Dashboard
* Add an interactive element to the vizzes

## Import the Data
For this lab, you will continue to use the Superstore data set you have been using and you will use the visualizations you have already created. You should have saved the workbook you used in the __Useful Visualizations Lab__ so we will use those worksheets and assemble them into a _Dashboard_ that and we will add some interactivity to it as well.

## Create a Dashboard
Using one of the two methods described in the previous lesson, create a new blank _Dashboard_.  Once the _Dashboard is open, you should see all of your worksheets you have created on the left side of the screen. To add these visualizations to the workspace, we will first need to create some containers to put them in so we can organize them. Before creating the containers, however, you will first want to take a moment and decide how your dashboard will be viewed. Once you have an idea of what you want your dashboard to look like, you can begin adding the objects and vizzes. Your final dashboard should look similar to image below.

## Design Your Dashboard
In order to make it easier to create your dashboard, you might want to take a moment and sketch what you want the final product to look like. Planning what it will look like in the end will allow you to be much more efficient in the creation process. Below is a picture of what the final product should look like, so in setting up your dashboard, you will need to decide which objects and containers you will need to create this dashboard.

## Adding Containers
In the example, you can see that we want two vizzes side by side, so you will need to, first, add a horizontal container to the workspace. You will also see that there are two other containers that we will need, so add two more horizontal containers to the workspace. Don't worry about the sizes of the containers yet, you can adjust those once you have added in the vizzes.

## Adding in the Vizzes
The top of the example viz has the bar chart on the left and the scatter plot on the right. Drag each of those vizzes into the top container. The result should be something like the image below.

Next, let's add in another _Horizontal Container_ under the one we were just working with. Once you have that container, drag the _Line Graph_ into the container. Your _Dashboard_ should look like the one below.
